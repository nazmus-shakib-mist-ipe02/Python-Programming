    "### Dict comprehensions\n",
    "Comprehensions aren't relegated merely to the world of lists. There are many other objects you can build using comprehensions, such as dictionaries, pervasive objects in Data Science. You will create a dictionary using the comprehension syntax for this exercise. In this case, the comprehension is called a dict comprehension.\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall that the main difference between a list comprehension and a dict comprehension is the use of curly braces {} instead of []. Additionally, members of the dictionary are created using a colon :, as in <key> : <value>.\n",

    "You are given a list of strings fellowship and, using a dict comprehension, create a dictionary with the members of the list as the keys and the length of each string as the corresponding values.\n",

    "### Instructions\n",
    "\n",
    "- Create a dict comprehension where the key is a string in fellowship and the value is the length of the string. Remember to use the syntax <key> : <value> in the output expression part of the comprehension to create the members of the dictionary. Use member as the iterator variable.\n",
