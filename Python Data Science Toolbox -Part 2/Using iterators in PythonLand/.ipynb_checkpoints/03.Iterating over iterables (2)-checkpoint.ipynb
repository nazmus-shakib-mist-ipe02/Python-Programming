    "Recall that range() doesn't actually create the list; instead, it creates a range object with an iterator that produces the values until it reaches the limit (in the example, until the value 4). If range() created the actual list, calling it with a value of 10100 may not work, especially since a number as big as that may go over a regular computer's memory. The value 10100 is actually what's called a Googol which is a 1 followed by a hundred 0s. That's a huge number!\n",
