    "### Writing a generator to load data in chunks (2)\n",
    "In the previous exercise, you processed a file line by line for a given number of lines. What if, however, you want to do this for the entire file?\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case, it would be useful to use generators. Generators allow users to lazily evaluate data. This concept of lazy evaluation is useful when you have to deal with very large datasets because it lets you generate values in an efficient manner by yielding only chunks of data at a time instead of the whole thing at once.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this exercise, you will define a generator function read_large_file() that produces a generator object which yields a single line from a file each time next() is called on it. The csv file 'world_dev_ind.csv' is in your current directory for your use.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that when you open a connection to a file, the resulting file object is already a generator! So out in the wild, you won't have to explicitly create generator objects in cases such as this. However, for pedagogical reasons, we are having you practice how to do this here with the read_large_file() function. Go for it!\n",
    "\n",
    "### Instructions\n",
    "\n",
    "- In the function read_large_file(), read a line from file_object by using the method readline(). Assign the result to data.\n",
    "- In the function read_large_file(), yield the line read from the file data.\n",
    "- In the context manager, create a generator object gen_file by calling your generator function read_large_file() and passing file to it.\n",
    "- Print the first three lines produced by the generator object gen_file using next()."
